weight: 1
description: Working with operator-sdk cli for ansible/helm based operators

**Note:** For Golang Operators this CLI has been deprecated. Please consult the [new CLI reference][new_CLI] doc.

[new_CLI]:/docs/cli/golang

<!---
Links in the CHANGELOG reference "website/content/en/docs/cli"
so we can't change the legacy CLI doc path

TODO: Once versioned docs are supported on the website the CHANGELOG notes
that link to the legacy CLI should be updated before being removed on the master
branch.
